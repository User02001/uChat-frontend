                    "answer": "Your handle is your unique identifier on uChat (like @yourname). Handles must be unique and can't be a one that is already used. It is because if all usernames and handles were the same, you cannot differentiate different users on who is who, right? That's why handles exist. You should choose a handle that is 3-20 characters long."
